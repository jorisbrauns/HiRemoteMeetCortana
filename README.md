Stop dreaming!
No, really... it’s about time to wake up now. So, why is it so hard?

Get up and maximize your energy with our Cortana (by Windows 10) and Raspberry Pi light-hack!

It’s so easy: tell Cortana at what time you want to wake up and she will gently light up your room with whatever bulb you want.



Why is this so great?

At work, you are noticed about an important meeting tomorrow-­morning? 

Or with friends, you plan a great journey starting early in the morning?

Now, you don’t have to wait anymore to set your wake­up light till you get home!

Just tell Cortana from wherever you are and she’ll activate your Raspberry Pi­selected light­bulb to slowly start glowing until full capacity at the moment you have to wake up.

You’ll never forget to set your wake­up light but will  enjoy the benefits of light­activated endorphins.

Easy to implement
